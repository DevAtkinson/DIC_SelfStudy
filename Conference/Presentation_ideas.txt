Intro to DIC
- talk about images and how they are a matrix of light intensity values
- methods of surface fitting and solving n-dimensional problems
- how DIC is essentially a surface fitting method
- relate optical flow to real world displacements
- DIC encompasses both setting up the problem and solving it - generally limited control over this
- explain DVC 
- advantages of method - non-contact - post processing - investigate more complex material behaviour





- problems with DIC and material science - discontinuities with continuous assumption - high strain gradient - high rotation

- field fitting to isolate cracks and use different shape function (or strain energy)


what it enables us to do

Brief history of DIC
- introduced in the 1980s and since has been improved and adapted ever since

Brief intro
- what dic is - determine optical flow between images and use calibration to relate it back to real world displacements and deformations
- why it is useful
- what advantages over conventional methods - determine displacment and deformation (strain gauge/extensometer only deformation) - full field
- how help with investigating new more complex material properties

Explain what DIC is fundementally
- what image is - matrix of light intensity values
- DIC is basically a surface fitting problem - however surface deforms between images (for material science) - one subset surface is fitted to another at a time
- to mathematically fit the two surfaces two things are needed
	1. a way of determining the quality of the fit between the two surfaces - correlation criterion
	2. a mathematical relation explaining how the surface deforms - warp function
- these define the correlation problem (the surface fitting problem)
- then use optimization algorithm to solve for the parameters of the warp function that give the best correlation coefficient
- this is done over the whole image by doing it to many subsets that overlap

Issues with DIC in material science
- continuous assumption breaks down in presence of discontinuities such as cracks to give spurious displacements
- warp functions can be rigid which doesn't allow the user to make use of a priori knowledge of the expected material behaviour
- 

How improve by allowing more control over the algorithm
