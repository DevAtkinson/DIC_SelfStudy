Intro to DIC
- talk about images and how they are a matrix of light intensity values
- methods of surface fitting and solving n-dimensional problems
- how DIC is essentially a surface fitting method
- relate optical flow to real world displacements
- DIC encompasses both setting up the problem and solving it - generally limited control over this
- explain DVC 
- advantages of method - non-contact - post processing - investigate more complex material behaviour





- problems with DIC and material science - discontinuities with continuous assumption - high strain gradient - high rotation

- field fitting to isolate cracks and use different shape function (or strain energy)
